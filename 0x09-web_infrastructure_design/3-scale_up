#### Specifics : 
The web infrastructure design is further leveled up with addition of other elements:

- `Server 3` : The addition of another server improves the reliability of the infrastructure since more traffic can be handled and there is more redundancy in case of device failure.

- `Load Balancer 2` :  Another load balancer is added and configured as a cluster. This eleminates SPOF on the load balancer functionality, enabling high availability in
the case one fails.

#### Design Issues and faults:

Having servers with all the same components means that each server in the cluster has the same hardware and software configuration. For example, if you have a cluster of web servers, each web server would have the same hardware specifications such as CPU, RAM, and storage capacity, as well as the same software configuration, including the operating system, web server software, and any necessary libraries or dependencies.

The idea behind having servers with all the same components is to ensure consistency and reliability. It simplifies server management and configuration, as administrators only need to manage one configuration that can be replicated across all servers. This reduces the likelihood of errors or inconsistencies that can occur when managing multiple configurations.

Having servers with all the same components can also make it easier to scale out or horizontally. If you need to add more capacity to your infrastructure, you can simply add another server with the same configuration as the existing servers, and it will seamlessly integrate with the cluster.

However, having servers with all the same components also has some drawbacks. If there is a hardware or software issue that affects one server in the cluster, it can potentially affect all the other servers with the same configuration. Additionally, having all the servers with the same components can limit flexibility, as you may not be able to easily switch to different hardware or software configurations if needed. 

Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem because their consumption will not grow the same way between each of them (we might want to have more database servers than application servers for instance).

Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem because when there is maintenance performed on a server for a specific component, it will affect other components that are on it

To fix this, add servers containing a single component inside them (such as a web server, application server or database)
