### Specifics :
- User inputs the `**domain**` name www.foobar.com  into the computer browser.
`**The Domain name**`; www.Fobar.com, is a user friendly name used to link the IP address of the website.
The IP address is a series of numbers which are hard to memorize. eg. 127.345.456.4
The purpose of the domain name is to have a human user friendly representation of the website address.

- For the users computer to map the correct IP address to the domain name, the `**DNS**` system is used. 
`**The Domain Name System(DNS)**` is a system that uses different process and resources to find the correct 
IP address of the domain name being queried. In the DNS system,  www.foobar.com is a cononical(alias) name record 
and subdomain of the main root domain name; foobar.com .The root domain name has an A record of 8.8.8.8, which is the IP Address.
Hence, the Cononical Name(name) www.foobar.com , points to the root domain name foobar.com which then points to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

- The IP address 8.8.8.8 is the address of the `**server**`(Nginx) storing the data details of the website www.foobar.com.
`**A server**` is a powerful computer, connected to the internet that provides different functions and services to the end users computers.
In these case, the server 8.8.8.8 is storing the webpage data and other webpage details of www.foobaar.com which the user is requesting to visit.

- The end user's computer brower using `**HTTP**` sends a request to the server for a response with the details of the www.foobar.com website.
`**Hyper Text Transfer protocols(HTTP)**` is a software both on the users computer browser and the end server computer which determines and controls
how the text files and other details of the webpage will be transferred between the two computers.

- `**The Web Server**` provides a static experience of responding and sending back to the client user the pre-stored text and data files of the webpage.
The files stored in HTML, CSS and JAVA script format will be sent back to end users computer browser and displayed as it was stored and designed.

- `**An application server**`  is a software used to provide additional services such as a dynamic web service, where the end user can also upload data
to the website while including so many other additional functions.
Here the application server can update, adjust, moderate, and install different datas and services on the website and computer systems to create a dynamic usage for
both end users of the website.

- The application server would make use of a `**database**`
`**A Database**` is a system that stores different forms of data. It allows the management, creation, updating, and retrieval of data. The Database also gives 
structure to organization business information. With the Data base, a **code base** and the application server, data of both client user and organization user
can be manipulated to create different forms of services.

#### Design Issues and faults:
- `**Single point of failure (SPOF)**`: Failure or malfunction of the server can lead to an entire failure of the system. To avoid this
a second server will be needed as a redundancy.

- `**Downtime**` : A single server can also cause downtime during maintenance, because users canâ€™t access a server if it is offline during maintenance, restart, and update.

- `**scalability**` : Also a single server can affect scalability and downtime during high traffic, this can be resolved by adding a second server to share the traffic loads.
