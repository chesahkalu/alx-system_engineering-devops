# Web stack debugging :page_with_curl: 0x1B-web_stack_debugging_4

## About this project :bulb:

In these projects, I learnt how to debug webstacks in isolated containers,
and fixing the web stack to a working state. For each
task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* [0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp](./0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp): Puppet manifest
  that increases the amount of traffic an Apache web server can effectively handle.

* [1-user_limit.pp](./1-user_limit.pp): Puppet manifest that changes the operating system
  configuration so that it is possible to login with the user `holberton` and open a file
  without error.
