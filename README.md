# Alx-System_engineering-devops :computer:

## :bulb: This repository contains most basic and advanced lessons/practices on system engineering devops. 

### :page_with_curl: In this repository, i worked on various devops concepts while getting hands-on experience with some tools and technologies provided in ALX Software Engineering program.Some of the concepts I worked on include:

- Linux / Unix commands and shell scripting
- Networks / Networking Theories and concepts
- API ( Application Programming Interface ) and Web Services
- System administration on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 
- Web infrastructure design:
    * Infrastructure as code
    * Servers ( web-servers and application-servers )
    * DNS
    * Firewall
    * SSL
    * Load balancing
    * Webstack monitoring
    * Database administration / backup
    * Webstack debugging
